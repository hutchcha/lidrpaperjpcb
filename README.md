Welcome to my GitHub Repo for the analysis code for our paper published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry B.

I have modularized my code so that other people might be able to use it on their own machines, and hope that it all works as intended. I ommitted the plotting code, and these scripts will produce numpy arrays that are then saved to text files or dictionaries when applicable.

Please feel free to use these as you see fit!
